Idea:

1) Create partitions of various file systems
2) Mount the fs on / and check try to see if overlay failed on that specific file 

Results:
ext3: no errors
ext2: no errors
ext4: no errors (duh)
btrfs: no errors
bcachefs: no errors
exfat: failed
f2fs: no errors
fat16 (msdos): failed
fat32 (msdos): failed
hfs: failed
hfs+: failed
jfs: no errors
swap: failure to mount swap partition (no fault of overlayfs)
LVM2: failure to mount LVM2 partition (no fault of overlayfs)
minux: no errors
nilfs2: no errors
ntfs: no errors (however when doing stat -f it shows the fs type as "UNKNOWN" followed by an address)
resierfs: failure to mount resierfs partition (no fault of overlayfs)
udf: no errors
xtfs: no errors

Solution:
Now that we know what fs types fail we can check before the overlay call and test if the dir is a type that fails 
(maybe using stat -f). If it does lets just ignore the over call and go straight to the mergerfs call
